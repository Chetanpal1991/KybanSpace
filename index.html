            At Kybanspace, we believe that space is for everyone. Our mission is to create a vibrant,
            open community where space enthusiasts from across India can come together, share their ideas, and build the
            future of space technology — together. <br><br>

            Whether you're a student, researcher, engineer, coder, designer, kid, or simply passionate about the cosmos, this
            is your platform. We aim to foster collaboration, learning, and innovation through open-source initiative in
            the space tech. From satellite systems to propulsion, from simulations to communication — if it’s
            space-related, there’s a place for it here. <br><br>

            We are not driven by profit — there are no financial transactions or monetary expectations involved. This is
            a purely open-source, volunteer-driven initiative dedicated to knowledge sharing and collaborative growth. <br><br>

            We’re not just a community — we're building an open-source space company powered by talent, curiosity, and a
            shared vision. No matter your background or location in India, if you have the passion and the will to
            contribute, you’re welcome. <br><br>

            Let’s dream big, build together, and make space more accessible for all. <br><br>

            Join us, and let’s launch the future. <br><br>

            <div class="article_header space-text-intro">Hubble Telescope</div>
            <div class="text">NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has made a groundbreaking disc ..

                Planetary nebulae like Kohoutek 4-55 are the finale at the end of a giant star’s life. Once a red giant
                has shed its last layers of gas, its compact core contracts further, leading to a last burst of nuclear
                fusion.

                The subsequent exposed core reaches extremely hot temperatures, "radiating ultraviolet light that
                energizes the enormous clouds of gas cast off by the star. The ultraviolet light ionizes atoms in the
                gas, making the clouds glow brightly," wrote NASA's Hubble mission team at Goddard Space Flight Center
                in Greenbelt, Maryland. <br><br> Kohoutek 4-55 is situated 4,600 light-years away from Earth in the
                constellation Cygnus (the Swan). It is part of the Milky Way galaxy.

                That is, for now: the relative brief phase of fusion in the core will end after only tens of thousands
                of years, spelling an end to this spectacle. Left behind will be white dwarf star that will never
                illuminate the clouds swirling around it again.

            <div class="article_header space-text-intro">Black Hole</div>
            <div class="text">Humans are quite rightly fascinated by black holes, but could we ever harness them as an
                energy source? New research poses this question in order to explore some of the most wonderous cosmic
                events.

                Black holes are bounded by outer barriers called event horizons that prevent us from ever viewing their
                interiors or their hearts, singularities at which all known laws of physics collapse. This means black
                holes couldn't be more mysterious. Black holes are also unlike anything found on Earth or in the solar
                system in another respect: their sheer power.

                When surrounded by matter, black holes can be responsible for the most energetic phenomena in the known
                universe, including quasars that outshine the combined light of the billions of stars found in the
                galaxies that contain them. It's little wonder that physicists have long pondered if some of this energy
                could be harvested. <br> <br> The energy that Penrose and now Pinochet suggest could theoretically be
                extracted from black holes is the kinetic energy that keeps them rotating.

                Obviously, black holes aren't the only cosmic objects that rotate, but there is something very special
                about rotating black holes or "Kerr black holes" that isn't true for other spinning cosmic bodies

                "Kerr black holes are capable of spinning at speeds close to the speed of light in a vacuum, which is
                the maximum speed allowed by relativistic physics," Pinochet said. "No other object in the universe
                could do this because centrifugal forces would tear it apart."<br><br>As they spin, the immense
                gravitational influence of Kerr black holes drag the very fabric of space around with them in a process
                called "frame-dragging" or the "Lense-Thirring effect," named after the physicists who first proposed
                it, Josef Lense and Hans Thirring.

                This churning of the fabric of space means that the objects and matter surrounding a black hole cannot
                sit still, and are dragged along as the black hole swirls its surroundings.

                "As we all learn in school, the most basic form of energy is that associated with motion, called kinetic
                energy, which depends on speed," Pinochet added. "So, a rotating black hole has rotational kinetic
                energy, and by pulling space along with it, it imparts its extraordinary rotational energy to the
                objects in its surroundings."
